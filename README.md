# CSS INTEGRATION 

During this exercise we had to recreate three interfaces pixel-perfect. This exercise was meant for us to see how much we learned and how far we have came on our web development journey from the start of the training. As this was a mock test, we were not allowed to ask for help from our fellow juniors, to make it more look like a real life work-environment.


# Details

- Mode: solo
- Type of Challenge: consolidation
- Duration: 1 day (half a day per interface)
- Deployment strategy: GitHub Pages
